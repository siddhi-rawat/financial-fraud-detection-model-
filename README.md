Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model with Dashboard

Overview

The Advanced Financial Fraud Detection Model with Dashboard is a robust fraud detection system that integrates machine learning techniques with a real-time dashboard. This project leverages Power BI for data visualization, Scikit-learn and TensorFlow for fraud detection, and Flask for real-time analysis.

Features

Machine Learning-Based Fraud Detection: Utilizes classification algorithms to detect fraudulent transactions.

Real-Time Analysis: Implements a Flask-based API to process transactions dynamically.

Power BI Dashboard: Provides interactive data visualizations for fraud trends and transaction patterns.

Scalable and Modular Design: Ensures flexibility for further enhancements and integrations.

Technologies Used

Power BI: For data transformation, visualization, and dashboard creation.
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): To create advanced calculations and performance metrics.
Power Query Editor: For data transformation and cleaning.
Getting Started
To explore the Fraud Detection project, follow these steps:

Prerequisites

Power BI Desktop (latest version)
Python 3.x and required libraries
Kaggle dataset (financial fraud data)
Installation
Download the Dataset

Obtain the financial fraud dataset from Kaggle.
Open Power BI Desktop

Install it if you havenâ€™t already.
Load the Data

Go to Home > Get Data > CSV (or respective format).
Select the dataset file and click Load.
Transform and Clean Data

Use Power Query Editor for data preparation:
Go to Home > Transform Data.
Apply necessary transformations.
Train and Deploy the Model

Use Scikit-learn and TensorFlow to train fraud detection models.
Deploy the Flask API for real-time predictions.
Create KPIs and Dashboards

Use DAX for custom metrics::

Go to Modeling > New Measure to define new metrics.
Design and arrange visualizations.

Publish the Report
To share your report with others, publish it to the Power BI service:
Save your Power BI file.
Go to Home > Publish in Power BI Desktop.
Sign in with your Power BI account if prompted.
Select a workspace in the Power BI service where you want to publish the report.
Once published, access the report in the Power BI service to share it with stakeholders via a link or by embedding it in other platforms.
